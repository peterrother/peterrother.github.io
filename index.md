## About Me ##
I am Peter Rother, a 28-year old American Web Developer
who lives in Cincinnati, Ohio. I was born and raised here
and studied at St. Xavier High School as well as the
University of Cincinnati, majoring in Information Systems.

I’m a passionate fan of the German language and culture.
After having studied in both Germany and Austria I started
working in Munich, Germany, home of Oktoberfest. Since then
I’ve developed quite the penchant for traveling throughout
Europe. Although Cincinnati remains my home, many of my
interests revolve around our friends over the pond. Germany
is especially home to me because of my German heritage and
Cincinnati’s largely German roots.

Other than that I’m an avid microbrew beer drinker,
locovore, coffee nut, son of a baker, tennis player and runner.
