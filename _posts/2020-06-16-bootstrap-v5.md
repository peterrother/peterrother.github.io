From the [Bootstrap Blog](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/):

>[…] we’re very happy to say that with v5, Bootstrap no longer depends on jQuery and we’ve dropped support for Internet Explorer. We’re sharpening our focus on building tools that are more future-friendly, and while we’re not fully there yet, the promise of CSS variables, faster JavaScript, fewer dependencies, and better APIs certainly feel right to us.

I am still in awe that this [self-proclaimed](https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/about/overview/#team) and notably accurate [small team of developers](https://github.com/orgs/twbs/people) keeps cranking out such exciting, new, and significant updates, all while licensed under the [MIT License](https://mit-license.org).

I work with this front-end framework everyday in my day job and would have a remarkably cumbersome time without it. To have access to such an impressive, responsive, and accessible UI free of charge seems to me like it should be unheard-of.

I also just discovered they have an [open collective link](https://opencollective.com/bootstrap), where you can support the Bootstrap team monetarily. For me, this was a no-brainer.
