I've mentioned my [go-to weather site](/2020/02/07/micropost-24.html) before for USA-centric weather conditions. Here's a simple [bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) I use all the time to not only fetch current local conditions, but also check up on those around the USA. Make sure you set the `YOURZIPCODE` value at the end to be able to quickly access your local weather. The prompt automatically highlights the zip code, so you can easily start typing as soon as you click the bookmarklet to fetch weather from anywhere else in the states by zip or city/state.

[ðŸŒ¤Weather](javascript:location%20=%20'https://forecast.weather.gov/zipcity.php?inputstring='+encodeURIComponent(prompt('Enter%20city%20or%20zip','YOURZIPCODE'));) â€” Drag this link to your Favorites Bar and edit the address before using or copy/paste the code below to a new bookmark, ensuring your local zip code is set.

    javascript:location%20=%20'https://forecast.weather.gov/zipcity.php?inputstring='+encodeURIComponent(prompt('Enter%20city%20or%20zip','YOURZIPCODE'));

Happy springtime!
