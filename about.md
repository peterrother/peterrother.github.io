I am Peter Rother, a {{ "now" | date: "%Y" | minus: 1985 }}-year old American web application developer who lives in the [Over-the-Rhine][otr] neighborhood of [Cincinnati, Ohio][cincinnati]. I was born and raised on the westside of Cincinnati and studied at [St. Xavier High School][st-xavier] and the [University of Cincinnati][uc], having received a BBA in [Information Systems][uc-is]. I currently build online ESG/EHS software alongside an amazing global team at [Benchmark Gensuite&reg;][benchmark].

I am a passionate fan of the German language and culture. After studying in both Germany and Austria I worked in Cincinnati's sister city, [Munich, Germany][munich], home of Oktoberfest. Since then I have developed quite the penchant for traveling throughout Europe.

Although Cincinnati remains my home, many of my interests revolve around our friends over the pond. Germany is especially home to me because of my German heritage and Cincinnati‚Äôs largely German roots. In 2010 a few friends and I started [Cincideutsch][cincideutsch], a local German-speaking organization that meets every Monday evening for Stammtisch.

I am also a runner, coffee aÔ¨Åcianado, Apple follower, public transit geek, beer nerd, and indie folk music lover.
