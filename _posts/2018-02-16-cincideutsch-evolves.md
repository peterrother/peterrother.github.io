Last week, [Cincideutsch][cincideutsch], the local German language club that I helped found, celebrated its 7th year anniversary. Pictured below you’ll see two of the cofounders, Linda and me. It was an event not to be missed, as our organization looks to evolve more than ever before this year, starting with our official membership.

As a non-profit organization, Cincideutsch has a lot of potential to work with the local community and actively promote our proud German heritage in Cincinnati. In having official members, we are hoping to find new channels of donorship and elicit ideas from our core devotees.

If you are in the Cincinnati Tri-state area and have any interest in German language and culture, consider joining us at our weekly Stammtisch at [Mecklenburg Gardens][mecks] at 6pm.
