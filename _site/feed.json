What a magnificent feeling it is after almost three years of dating. I could not be happier to be spending the rest of my life with my best friend and strongest supporter in life. ðŸ¥‚</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://localhost:4000/assets/img/engaged.jpg\" alt=\"An Engagement Photo\" /></p>\n\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Iâ€™m returning to the world of online journaling in this age of mass microblogging in hopes of reminding netizens that not everything revolves around two or three social media platforms.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a world wide web wherein someone wants to know what another is up toâ€”they could navigate to that personâ€™s domain and be immediately presented with micro updates, long-form reads, photographs, stories, music, and more. Guess what? They can. Even more, they can share these publications with friends using hyperlinks. They can even comment via email and express how much they liked something.</p>\n\n<p>Today, I embark on a simple mission to share bits and pieces of my life, the thoughts swirling in my head, and anything that I deem worth sharing with people who are curious to know. There will be no tracking of any kind. I will not present you with advertisements of things youâ€™ve been shopping for. It will simply be my words and my media.</p>\n\n<p>Should you be interested in a conversation regarding one of my posts or more, Iâ€™ll gladly discourse with you via email. Please find my email address in the footer section of this page.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, if you donâ€™t like following me, no need to press an <em>Unfollow</em> button. Simply close your browser window.</p>\n",
