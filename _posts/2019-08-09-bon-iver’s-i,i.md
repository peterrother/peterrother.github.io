Matthew Strauss, [writing for Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bon-iver-ii/):

> There’s no more hiding on i,i. Justin Vernon takes the Bon Iver sound and reassembles it like a cubist collage, with his voice right out front. All the familiar elements are here—impressionist swells of sound, impenetrable-yet-tender lyrics, mesmerizing studio tricks—and they are buoyed by Vernon’s supple baritone, the instrument he knows how to manipulate best. Acoustic guitar, horns, and piano return to prominence alongside the jittery electronics and synths that Vernon has lately favored. But the mood he conjures with these elements feels new. These songs don’t swallow you whole with grandeur; they look outward, leaving some room for the rest of the world.

A musician of our time, Justin Vernon has one of the most distinctive voices in the industry. While his lyrics are often difficult to follow, there is a certain contentment evoked by his surreal yet highly calculated sounds.
