We ventured onto the mountain hiking trails again during our early spring trip to Colorado last month in [San Isabel National Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Isabel_National_Forest) by [Salida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salida,_Colorado). We managed to skirt around the snow piles and stumble upon some magnificent views.
