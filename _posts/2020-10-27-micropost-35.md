Today, I created a new style for dead simple HTML pages called [dirtcheapcss](https://peterrother.com/dirtcheapcss/). It's 348 bytes, works on mobile, supports dark mode, and reads pleasantly. I think it's ideal for documentation, blogs, notes, and more, but feel free to use to your heart's content.
