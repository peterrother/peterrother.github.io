			<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
			<p>I am Peter Rother, a 28-year old American Web Developer
			who lives in
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>.
			I was born and raised here and studied at
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Xavier_High_School_(Cincinnati)">St. Xavier High School</a>
			as well as the
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cincinnati">University of Cincinnati</a>,
			majoring in Information Systems.</p>
			<p>I am a passionate fan of the German language and culture.
			After having studied in both Germany and Austria I started
			working in Cincinnati's sister city,
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich">Munich, Germany</a>, home
			of Oktoberfest. Since then I have developed quite the penchant
			for traveling throughout Europe. Although Cincinnati remains
			my home, many of my interests revolve around our friends over
			the pond. Germany is especially home to me because of my German
			heritage and Cincinnatiâ€™s largely German roots.</p>
			<p>Other than that I am an avid microbrew beer drinker,
			locovore, coffee nut, son of a baker, tennis player and runner.</p>
