## Whiskey-based

### Boulevardier

A cousin of the Negroni, the Boulevardier substitutes bourbon for gin. It was developed by Erskine Gwynne, an American socialite with ties to the Vanderbilt family. Gwynne expatriated to Paris, where he founded the literary magazine, _Boulevardier_, described as the best read before, between, and after cocktails. The cocktail was first detailed by Scottish bartender, Harry McElhone, in 1927.

#### Ingredients

* 1½ oz bourbon
* 1 oz Campari
* 1 oz sweet vermouth
* Orange peel

#### Steps

1. Combine all ingredients in mixing glass
2. Stir well
3. Strain into old-fashioned glass with ice
4. Garnish with orange peel

### Old Timber

A simple, fall oriented cocktail from Gabe Cothes, lead bartender at San Francisco's **Salt House**. Cothes adds a cinnamon stick to further boost the drink's cozy aromas. He calls his cocktail "Old Timber," saying that "the garnish looked like old wood that had fallen into the water."
