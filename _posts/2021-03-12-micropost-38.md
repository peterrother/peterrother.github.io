From [Kirby Kevinson's blog](https://kirby.kevinson.org/blog/iso-8601-the-better-date-format/):

> In my opinion, ISO 8601 seems clearly superior to other date formats when it comes to international communication (such as posting things online), and as you can see, I have enough reasons to say so. While the format certainly has an audience, it’s unfortunate that it’s not as big as it could be.

It's hard to believe we still need people to advocate for ISO 8601 in this decade.
