## Whiskey-based

### Boulevardier

A cousin of the Negroni, the Boulevardier substitutes bourbon for gin. It was developed by Erskine Gwynne, an American socialite with ties to the Vanderbilt family. Gwynne expatriated to Paris, where he founded the literary magazine, _Boulevardier_, described as the best read before, between, and after cocktails. The cocktail was first detailed by Scottish bartender, Harry McElhone, in 1927.

#### Ingredients

* 1½ oz bourbon
* 1 oz Campari
* 1 oz sweet vermouth
* Orange peel

#### Steps

1. Combine all ingredients in mixing glass
2. Stir well
3. Strain into old-fashioned glass with ice
4. Garnish with orange peel

### Old Timber

A simple, fall oriented cocktail from Gabe Cothes, lead bartender at San Francisco's **Salt House**. Cothes adds a cinnamon stick to further boost the drink's cozy aromas. He calls his cocktail "Old Timber," saying that "the garnish looked like old wood that had fallen into the water."

#### Ingredients

* 1½ (or 2 oz) rye whiskey
* ¼ oz Jelínek Fernet
* ¼ oz Combier (or Cointreau)
* Cinnamon stick garnish
* Orange twist garnish

#### Steps

1. Combine all ingredients (except garnish) in mixing glass
2. Stir 30 seconds with ice
3. Strain into old-fashioned glass with big ice cube
4. Garnish with cinnamon stick and orange twist

### Vieux Carre

1930s classic cocktail from New Orleans, created at the Hotel Monteleone. The word means old square, referring to the French Quarter. This is still a specialty at the hotel, and should be experienced while spinning on the Carousel Bar.

#### Ingredients

* 3/4 oz rye whiskey (sugg. Rittenhouse Bonded Rye)
* 3/4 oz cognac
* 3/4 oz sweet vermouth
* 1/2 teaspoon [benedictine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bénédictine)
* 1 dash Angostura
* 1 dash Peychaud's
* Cherry garnish

#### Steps

1. Combine all ingredients in mixing glass
2. Stir well
3. Strain into old-fashioned glass with ice
4. Garnish with cherry

## Long Drinks

### Americano

First served in [Gaspare Campari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspare_Campari)'s bar Caffè Campari in the 1860s, this cocktail is my go-to, low-proof drink of choice enjoyed as an apéritif. Similar to the Negroni, it's the perfect mate to a pasta dinner night giving ample oportunity to consume salatini and have a conversation before the main course. I've tweaked the official IBA recipe as I prefer a bit more "juice" and soda for a more effervescent drink.

#### Ingredients

* 2 oz Campari
* 2 oz Sweet Vermouth (sugg. Cocchi di Torino)
* 1 oz Soda water
* Orange slice
* Lemon twist

#### Steps

1. Combine Campari and Vermouth in highball glass
2. Add ice and stir for 5 seconds
3. Top with soda water
4. Garnish with orange slice and lemon twist
