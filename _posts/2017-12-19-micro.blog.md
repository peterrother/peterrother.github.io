If you don’t already follow him, I highly recommend a visit to [Manton Reece’s weblog][manton]. Today, he has [announced][mbrelease] the public availability of [Micro.blog][micro-blog], a project that originated on Kickstarter and now has begun steadily gaining a following on its own. The platform aligns with  my blog [mission][mission] and further facilitates the process of easily rolling out your own and aggregating blogs you follow into one view. My journal is now microblog-able so you can also follow me [from there][mymb].
