Our latest exploits in the UK led us to the [Lake District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_District), or "the Lakes" as they say, in [Cumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbria), northwest England. We managed to find a few glimmers of sunlight in a rain-swept landscape. Nothing that a few pints of English ale couldn't remedy after slogging through mud all day.
