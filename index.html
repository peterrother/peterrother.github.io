			<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
			<p>I am Peter Rother, a 28-year old American Web Developer
			who lives in Cincinnati, Ohio. I was born and raised here
			and studied at St. Xavier High School as well as the
			University of Cincinnati, majoring in Information Systems.</p>
			<p>I am a passionate fan of the German language and culture.
			After having studied in both Germany and Austria I started
			working in Munich, Germany, home of Oktoberfest. Since then
			I have developed quite the penchant for traveling throughout
			Europe. Although Cincinnati remains my home, many of my
			interests revolve around our friends over the pond. Germany
			is especially home to me because of my German heritage and
			Cincinnati’s largely German roots.</p>
			<p>Other than that I am an avid microbrew beer drinker,
			locovore, coffee nut, son of a baker, tennis player and runner.</p>
