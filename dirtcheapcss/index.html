			<h1>dirtcheapcss 👨🏼‍💻</h1>
			<p>
				I needed something to quickly stylize a simple HTML page
				into a readable document that looked mostly good on all
				devices. It weighs in at 348b and that's without any code
				minification. And this is what it looks like:
			</p>

			<code>
				&lt;style&gt;
					html {
						color-scheme: light dark;
						color: #333;
						font: 300 2.2ch/1.5 ui-sans-serif, sans-serif;
						max-width: 70ch;
						padding: 1ch;
						margin: auto;
					}
					h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 {
						margin-top: 3ch;
					}
					code,pre {
						font: 1.4ch ui-monospace, fixed;
						opacity: 0.6;
					}
					@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
						html,a:link {
							color: #ddd;
						}
						a:visited {
							color: #999;
						}
					}
				&lt;/style&gt;
			</code>

			<p>
				This is clearly not meant for every solution, but in a pinch
				it can turn an ugly blog or documentation into a decent
				thing to look at.
			</p>

			<h2>Requirements ✅</h2>

			<p>
				There are only a few key requirements for this style that I
				wanted, though this may evolve depending on the HTML components
				that I continue to utilize down the road.
			</p>

			<h3>Font 🖌</h3>
			<p>
				This might be more of a personal preference, but I really
				wanted to leverage the
				<a href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/">San Francisco</a>
				font native to Apple devices. To do this, I am using the
				<code>ui-sans-serif</code> keyword for the font-family, which
				should mean Windows/Linux could benefit from this as well.
			</p>

			<h3>Headers 📰</h3>
			<p>
				Font size and margins need to clearly separate content
				into digestable blocks. I added a margin-top to each of the
				headers except <code>h1</code> since that will always be
				the main site header. The extra spacing helps keep the core
				content associated with its parent header.
			</p>

			<h3>Lists 📝</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Unordered and ordered lists need to look nice</li>
				<li>That's pretty easy actually</li>
				<li>No fiddling with anything really</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Dark Mode 🌒</h3>
			<p>
				I like to keep my desktop on auto-light/dark mode. By setting
				a simple media query, the font color can be handled according to
				whichever mode is currently active.
			</p>

			<h3>Code 🤖</h3>
			<p>
				While syntax highlighting would be a major plus, for now I am
				okay with simply using a nice monospace font with an opacity
				setting to set it apart from the rest of the words on the page.
				I'm using the <code>ui-monospace</code> font, which on the Mac is
				SF Mono.
				<a href="https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js">Highlight.js</a>
				could be used as an add-on if the document is very code-heavy.
			</p>

			<h2>Future Considerations 🚀</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Tables</li>
				<li>Blockquotes</li>
				<li>Footnotes</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Credits 👋🏼</h2>
			<p>
				I was inspired when I came upon Leon Bambrick's
				(<a href="https://github.com/secretGeek">@secretGeek</a>)
				<a href="https://secretgeek.github.io/html_wysiwyg/html.html">truly
				naked, brutalist html quine</a>. I was intrigued towards the bottom
				of the page when he describes a minimal styling, which was ultimately
				adapted from <a href="https://jrl.ninja/etc/1/">58 bytes of css to
				look great nearly everywhere</a> by
				<a href="https://github.com/joshuarli">@joshuarli</a>.
