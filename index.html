		<section><h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am Peter Rother, a 30-year old American web application developer who lives in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-Rhine">Over-the-Rhine</a> neighborhood of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>. I was born and raised here and studied at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Xavier_High_School_%28Cincinnati%29">St. Xavier High School</a> and the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cincinnati">University of Cincinnati</a>, having majored in Information Systems.</p>

<p>I am a passionate fan of the German language and culture. After studying in both Germany and Austria I worked in Cincinnati's sister city, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich">Munich, Germany</a>, home of Oktoberfest. Since then I have developed quite the penchant for traveling throughout Europe.</p>

<p>Although Cincinnati remains my home, many of my interests revolve around our friends over the pond. Germany is especially home to me because of my German heritage and Cincinnatiâ€™s largely German roots. In 2010 a few friends and I started <a href="http://cincideutsch.com">Cincideutsch</a>, a local German-speaking organization who meets every Monday at 6pm for Stammtisch at <a href="http://www.mecklenburgs.net">Mecklenburg Gardens</a>.</p>

<p>I am also a runner, coffee a&#xFB01;cianado, Apple follower, tennis player, public transit geek, beer nerd and indie folk music lover.</p>
